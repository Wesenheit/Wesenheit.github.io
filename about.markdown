Hi! \\
My name is Mateusz Kapusta, currently I am 5th year Master's student at Warsaw University. Here I post projects I find interesting, mostly from the field of ML/Astronomy/Physics.
For more projects you can check my [repository](https://github.com/Wesenheit).

While I work a lot in the field of Astronomy/Physics, I enjoy to working on the intersection with Math/Computer Science.
In general, my interests lie in three different fields:
1. Bayesian data analysis, nonparametric modeling, inference methods.
2. Machine learning, simulation based inference, foundation models for astronomical observations.
3. Numerical methods, High Performance Computing, GPU programming.
