Hi! \\
My name is Mateusz Kapusta, currently I am 5th year Master's student at Warsaw University. Here I post projects I find interesting, mostly from the field of ML/Astronomy/Physics.
For more projects you can check my [repository](https://github.com/Wesenheit).

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Astrophysics within the College of Interdisciplinary Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences in 2023. 
My thesis was centered around the search for Dormant Black Holes in the OGLE data and was written under the supervision of Dr. Przemysław Mróz.
During my studies, I took a significant amount of lectures in the field of Computer 
Science and Mathematics. During those, I learned almost everything I know from the field of Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning, due to
great lectures from Prof. Ewa Szczurek. Right now I am finishing my Master's degree in Astrophysics under the supervision of Prof. Krzysztof Nalewajko.

While I work a lot in the field of Astronomy/Physics, I mostly love to work on the intersection with Math/Computer Science.
In general, my interests lie in three different fields:
1. Bayesian data analysis, nonparametric modeling, inference methods.
2. Machine learning, simulation based inference, foundation models for astronomical observations.
3. Numerical methods, High Performance Computing, GPU programming.
